# dungeoncrawl

The dungeoncrawl application as featured in the book [Hands On Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/) by Herbert Wolverson.

This repo contains my version of the application as I step through the book code and represents a first, hands-on experience with Rust (outside of the standard "Hello World" and toy projects).
